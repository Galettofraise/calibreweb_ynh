* Any known limitations, constrains or stuff not working, such as (but not limited to):
**Shipped version:** The shipped version is 0.6.12 - Pilar, but as the numbering changed in the calibre-web app, it is numbered as 0.96.12 in yunohost.
Users will be synchronized with authorized Yunohost users (having the calibreweb.main authorization group) automatically. In case of issue you may force the sync in the app itself.

Library will be placed in `/home/yunohost.multimedia/share/eBook` folder except if both :
 - calibreweb is set as a private application
 - calibreweb library is set as a public library

In this case the library will be set in `/home/yunohost.multimedia/[admin]/eBook` folder. Library folder can always be changed manually in the application settings by the administrator.

## OPDS
For OPDS to work, most OPDS-readers will require the app must be set in public mode.
Also, you may have to activate the "anonym browsing" for some reader to access book covers or download books ([source](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/FAQ#which-opds-readers-work-with-calibre-web)).



## Backup library

By default, Yunohost backup process **will backup** Calibre library.
You may deactivate backup of the library with 
```
yunohost app setting calibreweb do_not_backup_data -v 1
```

By default, removing the app will **never** delete the library.


## Known Limitations

* Authorization access to library to be done manually after install if Calibre library was already existing (except in yunohost.multimedia directory), for example :
```
chown -R calibreweb: path/to/library
or
chmod o+rw path/to/library
``` 
* Do not use a Nextcloud folder. It's all right if the folder is an external storage in Nextcloud but not if it's an internal one : Changing the data in the library will cause trouble with the sync
* "Magic link feature is not yet available
* Change to library made outside calibreweb are not automatically updated in calibreweb. It is required to disconnect and reconnect to see the changes : Do not open a database both in calibre & calibreweb!
* Kobo Sync doesnâ€™t work when Calibre is installed on a subdomain. This issue is caused by nginx. However, it works great when installed on a path e.g. `https://domain.tld/calibreweb`

* Other infos that people should be aware of, such as:
    * any specific step to perform after installing (such as manually finishing the install, specific admin credentials, ...)
    * how to configure / administrate the application if it ain't obvious
    * upgrade process / specificities / things to be aware of ?
    * security considerations ?
